# 03 - ML Basics: Regression

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Train your first machine learning model to predict penguin body mass using physical features.

### ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Defined features (X) and labels (y)
- Split dataset into training and test sets
- Trained Linear Regression using scikit-learn
- Evaluated model with Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score
- Visualized predictions
