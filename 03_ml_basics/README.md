# ⚙️ 03 – Machine Learning Basics

This section introduces the foundations of **Supervised Machine Learning** — starting from regression, moving to classification, and then exploring interpretable tree-based models.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Linear Regression
- Predicting continuous values.
- Metrics: MSE, RMSE, R² Score.
- Hands-on: Housing price prediction example.

### 2️⃣ Logistic Regression (Penguin Classifier)
- Predicting categorical outcomes.
- Understood Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- Visualized and interpreted confusion matrices.
- Achieved 100% accuracy on the Penguin dataset.

### 3️⃣ Decision Trees 🌳 *(Coming Next)*
- Non-linear, interpretable models.
- Concepts: Gini, Entropy, Information Gain.
- Visualization using `plot_tree`.
