# 🐧 04: Classification – Penguin Classifier

This lesson introduces **classification models** using the famous **Penguin dataset**.

## 🧠 Concepts Learned
- What classification is and how it differs from regression.
- How to prepare labeled data for classification.
- How to train a **Logistic Regression** model using scikit-learn.
- Understanding:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
- Why **data scaling** and **model convergence** matter.

## 🧩 Files
- `penguin-classifier.ipynb` — Colab notebook implementing logistic regression on the penguin dataset.
- `README.md` — this document.

## ✅ Results
- Achieved **100% accuracy** on the test set.
- Perfect precision, recall, and F1-score for all classes.
- Clean diagonal confusion matrix (no misclassifications).

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Explore **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests**.
- Compare model performance and interpretability.
