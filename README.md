# 🧠 ML Roadmap

Welcome to **ML Roadmap** — my personal journey to learn **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence** from scratch through **hands-on, bite-sized lessons**.

---

## 🚀 About This Project

I’m an undergraduate student studying AI, and this repository documents everything I learn — step by step.  
Instead of watching long tutorials, I’m learning by **doing**, using **Google Colab** and **Kaggle** for all experiments.

Every folder in this repo represents a **learning stage**, with:
- 📘 Short lessons (Colab notebooks)
- 💡 Mini projects
- 🗂️ Notes on what I learned
